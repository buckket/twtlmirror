twtlmirror
~~~~~~~~~~

This script takes all tweets from a user’s home timeline on Twitter and posts them to one Mastodon account.
It makes use of the CW tag to display from which user the tweet originally came from.
Media entities like photos, gifs and videos are mirrored as well.

Example use case:
A few people I care about still use Twitter but I don’t want to check Twitter separately, so I’ve created a private
and locked bot account on my own Mastodon instance to which this script mirrors my Twitter home timeline. This way I
can keep up with their Tweets without them even having a Mastodon account or using a mirror script themselves.
Of course it is not possibly to interact with them as actions taken on Mastodon are not replicated on Twitter.

Requirements:
- Mastodon.py
- python-twitter
- requests

Configuration:
- Edit settings.py (Twitter, Mastodon API credentials)

Notes:
This script works best when used in combination with systemd timers or cron.
